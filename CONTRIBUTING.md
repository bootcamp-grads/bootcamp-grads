## House Rules

TBD

## Filing a pull request

- Generally, pull requests will be readily accepted from contributors who 
  fulfill the prerequisites listed above.

- Depending on the state of the repository at the time the contribution is
  made, there may be a pull request template available to help describe the
  contribution. Make use of these if they are helpful to you!

- Describe the problem that the pull request is trying to address, as well
  as the approach taken. You can use GitHub-Flavored Markdown in the opening
  post when creating a pull request to format your descriptions, like thus:

```markdown
## Problem

<insert description of the problem>

## Solution

<insert description of how the problem is solved>

```
